# UniversityLabs

This repository is intended to store all University labs and projects. I really doubt something interesting can be found here, that's why it's combined to one repository.

### JavaLabs
JavaFX application with dummy code. Nothing interesting unless you're a five-year-old.

### LinuxLabs
Some scripts and labs. Mostly kernel modules code.

### ModelLabs
System modelling project that can minimize functions. Was interesting to write for a change.

### OpenCVLabs
JavaFX application that captures video from camera. Can detect faces, make video gray-scaled and other useless but funny things.

### QTLabs
QT application written in C++. Time tracker with reminder to enter activity every N minutes.
